Hrmph. Kids these days with their loud music and weird coding styles.

This is my eslint style, based on how things were in the good ole days when people still used [K&R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style):
* Strings use double quotes. Single quotes are for characters.
* Semicolons aren't optional. You skip a semicolon and yer code won't compile.
* Indent is 4 spaces. Don't make me squint to see yer code blocks. Don't like it? Get a bigger monitor. Back in my day, monitors were 80 characters wide and we still used 4 spaces.
* Include documentation in yer code. I can't remember what I had fer breakfast, don't make me try to remember what my code does.
* Eat your veggies and write tests.

Don't like it? I don't wanna hear yer jibberjabber. Shaddup and move along before I put some rocksalt in my shotgun.

And just be happy that I didn't limit the line lengths to 80 characters...
